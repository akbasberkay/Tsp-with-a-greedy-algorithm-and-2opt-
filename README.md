# Tsp-with-a-greedy-algorithm-and-2opt-
This algorithm will help finding the close optimal solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem using the closest neighbor greedy algorithm and 2 opt local search. Hope it helps:)

I should add that in this code we had 2 constraints for 2 groups of customers that from the first group we needed to select at least 3, and 5 from the second.
